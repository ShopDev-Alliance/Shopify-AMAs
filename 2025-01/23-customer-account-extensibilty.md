## Key Statistics & Updates

- 875 million customers bought from Shopify stores in 2024
- Over 50% of Shopify merchants now using new customer accounts
- 40 launch partners at release
- 350+ apps supporting extensions

## Notable Q&A

### Q: Can you set a default page to redirect after login?

A: Currently not possible to redirect to a full-page extension by default. However:

- Can redirect to different pages in online store
- URL structure determines post-login destination
- Working on making this more flexible in future updates

### Q: When will we get support for alternative login methods?

A: Roadmap for 2025 includes:

- Social login (Google, etc.) coming first
- Phone number login being considered
- Currently gathering feedback on priorities

### Q: How should developers approach full-page vs. inline extensions?

A: Considerations include:

- Use full-page for complex functionality
- Use inline extensions for simpler features
- Can implement both for flexibility
- Consider merchant customization needs
- Use extension collections for related features

## Development Best Practices

### Extension Structure

- Divide features across different extensions
- One feature per extension for better merchant experience
- Use extension collections for related functionality
- Consider editor experience and previews

### Integration Considerations

- Maintain customer authentication
- Ensure branding consistency
- Use native components
- Consider upgrade safety

## Future Development Areas

### Planned Features

- Social login integration
- Customer segmentation
- Improved targeting capabilities
- Enhanced personalization options

### Platform Changes

- Eventually deprecating legacy customer accounts
- Moving away from multi-pass
- Transitioning from legacy liquid pages
- Approximately one-year timeline for deprecation (when announced)

## Resources

- Customer Account API documentation
- Shopify Community Forums
- Partner Slack channel for customer accounts
- UX review support available from team

## Full unedited transcript

>> Yo. This is super hype. I think we're going to get started now. So welcome to the Shopify Devs Customer Account Extensions AMA. I'm Patrick. I'm @pmilligan on Twitter. I'm joined by a bunch of awesome people. We're going to get into so much fun stuff today. A bit about me. I've been at Shopify about three years. I'm hitting my fourth year. I've been working on customer accounts and login the entire time. I kind of run product for the team. We have all sorts of things always going on at Shopify. And I'm going to be joined here by-- we've got Graham, who's an amazing product person I work with. Ken's a dev manager for customer account extensions. And Lenko, UX manager. Wonderful people. I'm going to let them introduce themselves, and then I might brag about them slightly after and hype them up if they don't hype themselves up. So I'm going to go to Lenko first. Lenko, do you want to introduce yourself? Share whatever you want to share. >> For sure. Thanks, Patrick. Hi, everybody. I'm Nick. As Patrick said, I'm the UX manager here at Shopify, working on customer accounts. I've also been on the team for about four years, or coming up on four years, and working on pretty much customer accounts the entire time. It's really one of the most exciting times for our team at Shopify with the launch of Extensibility at the Boring Editions last December. And so we're super excited to be talking to the dev community today about kind of like how things have gone, what we've seen, and kind of the future of Extensibility. And with that, I'll pass it over to Kenza. >> Hey, everyone. My name is Kenza. I'm an engineering manager at Shopify, also within the customer accounts team, and my team owns things related to developer-facing features. So that includes customer accounts, Extensibility, but also includes the customer account API. So if you have questions about that, go for it. Very excited to be here. All right. I'll leave it to Graham to introduce himself. >> Hey, everyone. Graham here. I am a product manager, like Patrick mentioned, on the Shopify team. I am the most recent addition to this team, joined just under a year ago. So I got to just enjoy all of the fun work that this team has done over the last couple of years. But I'm also focused on Extensibility, like Kenza mentioned, anything developer experience, customer account API. Yeah, really excited to chat with you all about it. >> Yes. Amazing people. I'm sure you probably chatted with maybe some of these people in either the Shopify community forum or Shopify partner Slack. We're pretty active there, so if you ever want to talk to any of us. I'm also going to brag about Graham for like a second. Before joining Customer Account Extensions, he's actually been a PM at Smile, Loop, Disco, and other big Shopify apps. So he has a lot of empathy on the app side. I really like having him be on the team for that. So cool. I'm going to kind of just set the stage for maybe about five minutes or so and kind of open up some questions that we kind of got pre-done here. But then we'll also open up to questions from the group. We're pretty chill with like if you have a question or want to comment on something, just like smack the hand raised emoji. Also seeing some awesome people in the audience already. Kevin, you said you weren't going to be here and you're here right now. So that's really exciting that we ended up getting you to come by for this. So anyways, to set the stage, customer accounts is a really important part of commerce. Merchants really, really deeply care about it. They care about it for all sorts of reasons. I think at Shopify, we kind of set the stage where merchants really want out of their customer account functionality to allow customers to log in and do self-serve functionality. So do things like start a return or write a review or manage a subscription, et cetera, all these things. And what we've seen from the ecosystem over a long time is that to build all these self-serve functionality, we were seeing everybody build like a unique portal for returns, a unique portal for subscriptions, a unique portal for loyalty, et cetera. And ultimately what merchants kind of share, and I think customers want is that unified customer experience. And so we set out about three years ago to say, "Hey, how are we going to create this unified experience that people can offer their customers where they can log in once and do things themselves?" One of the really great like kind of flywheel benefits when we were kicking off the investment was that we see merchants like apparel merchants that have like maybe like 20% of their orders have an item that's returned. Well, right now that's not requiring anyone to log in to do returns about Shopify stores, but if actually you start building all of these self-serve functionality behind one login, all of a sudden you're going to greatly increase the number of logged in users. And that's something that we continue to see across merchants that are using extensions and getting all of their customer self-serve functionality in one place. This is really exciting because ultimately logged in customers can get better personalized experiences. We're reducing lots of clicks from the commerce journey. So this has been going on. We launched about two years ago the kind of out of the box portal, but it didn't work with apps. And that was obviously something that needs to happen. There's so many great apps. I think we estimate that around like 10% to 15% of all apps in the app store are around like some sort of customer account functionality, whether self-serve, personalization, et cetera. And so we kicked off a dev preview about a year ago to let developers kind of go crazy with this thing and build into it. We started working with people really hand in hand and closely with everyone. And actually at Winter Editions, we ended up shipping customer account extensions live. Now anyone can build and deploy an extension to a live store. We launched with 40 great launch partners, several of which I believe are on the call right now. So shout out many of you that are here for this. Maybe we'll drop a link in one of the threads here of all the launch partners that are there. But also there's over 350 apps that supported extensions. So we're really excited that the ecosystem showed up for this. And now as we go into 2025, we've got all sorts of things working on, but I'm going to kind of open it up to general questions. I kind of want to start with a question for Lenko, Kenza, and Graham. Extensions have now been out for a month-ish now. We're starting to see kind of customers react to this, merchants react to this. I'm wondering like for developers, if you had any type of like advice to devs or common questions that would help them build better extensions, or get their extensions adopted more. Graham, do you want to start off? Yeah, happy to. There's a lot of different things here that developers should be thinking about. But like one of the questions we get a ton is like, "Hey, why would I build in fully into customer accounts? I have this portal that I've already invested in a ton. Why would I link that into a full page extension or turn that into a full page extension or break that functionality down and put it into smaller inline extensions?" And it's a very reasonable question. And I think it comes from a really good place where developers want to solve problems for merchants and going and looking at recreating the portal and then using our native components and putting that into a full page extension or an inline extension may look like work that's like duplicative to what they've already done. And I would say that's a reasonable way of thinking about it. But there's, I think, two big considerations to make when building into customer account extensions. Like first and foremost, the customer must remain authenticated and only have to log in once. Patrick mentioned a bunch about making it easier for customers to be able to self-serve, making it really easy for customers to take those actions and removing clicks whenever possible. Keeping the customer authenticated and using Shopify's login for that will allow you to remove all of those clicks if you have an order lookup mechanism that many subscriptions or returns apps do. You can completely eliminate that step from the flow and a customer can just go to their order status page that they're already getting emailed, that already is sitting in their inbox. They can go to that order status page. They can click on a link to update their subscription straight from there. But making sure that customer is authenticated and only has to log in once makes that process so, so much easier. The other piece of it is building into a full page extension or using our components ensures branding is consistent between the merchant account and the portal so that the experience feels native. One of the really big advantages of customer account extensions is we have all of these components that inherit all the merchants branding. So they don't need to set up branding in your portal and their portal and then they need to try to match those between the two. If they have branding set up in their checkout, customer accounts automatically inherits that and those extensions will automatically inherit that as well. So it feels like a really native experience for customers. You can still link out to your old portal, but it really starts to introduce a lot of potential errors to keeping that customer authenticated or having that branding consistency. So we really, really recommend building into full page extensions, rebuild that portal, and it ends up being an N+1 for your merchants at the end of the day. That way that portal is upgrade safe. So as we improve the platform, your extension will improve on top of that. So yeah, it may seem like work in the short term, but I think in the long term, it ends up being a better path both for you and your merchants. Yes, absolutely. And I think that just driving the consistent experience is what we hear from, I think, our highest GMV merchants all the time. Opening up, I think, to Lenko and Kenza, any thoughts on what are things that you're hearing that would be important for devs to hear from the front lines of all these conversations we're having? Okay, I guess I can take this. Something that's important that, honestly, on our end, we need to do a better job of documenting, but from an engineering standpoint, if you don't divide your extensions, your features across different extensions, and you have multiple targets within a single extension, the merchant experience is really not great. The merchant experience on the editor has been built for one feature is one extension. And so if you put all of your features within one extension, the merchant experience is going to be very clunky. They're not going to understand all of the features that your extension has. It's just going to show up as one item on their list of app blocks, and they're going to add different features to different pages. So it's just, again, we need to do a better job of documenting this. But I think this is something that is confusing some merchants when developers don't divide their extensions, their features across different extensions. Right on. I know, Lenko, were you able to get your audio connected? Just wanted to make sure. Okay, cool. I think Lenko will rejoin us shortly. But he has thoughts on this question, I know. Okay, cool. So let's go ahead and open it up to questions. I want to start with some of the questions that people had messaged in prior. But again, I'm going to be – I think we've got a couple people in here looking for hand raises, and feel free to come up and ask questions directly. But I think we'll start with – let's start with Kevin's questions around are there extension targets planned for B2B draft orders? There's another question around is Personate a company, something you guys are looking into? Lots of B2B merchants want an easy way for sales reps to log in as buyer to order together. I can take these, but I don't know if Graham, Kenzo, Lenko, you have a take on the B2B draft order extensions? I can take this one. So it's something that we've talked about, but we're missing real life use cases for it, so we haven't planned for it yet. So if you want this, please tell us what you want to do with it, and we'll definitely consider adding targets on the B2B draft orders page. So, yeah, just something we've talked about, but haven't come up with actual real use cases from real partners and real merchants. So please tell us about them. Yeah, can we invite Kevin up? I don't know, Kevin, if you want to chat about that or if you're listening right now. I think the other question was around impersonating companies, something you guys are looking into. It's something that we think a lot about. I think that in addition to the B2B use case of having sales reps log in and have the buyer to order together is one case. I think there's lots of ways to solve that beyond impersonating. Right now, B2B merchants can go into the admin and place these orders directly. I think that there is something special about having a shared experience. There's also, I think, many D2C cases for impersonating a company, but of course you can imagine that at the scale of so many merchants, that doing this in a way that's super safe and super secure is really important. Many merchants have lots and lots of different staff members that they have access to or that they have at their companies that have different permissions, and the ability to impersonate really plays into that. So it's a pretty big investment, something that we continually are circling. I think right now we're focused on other platform gaps and other features, but something that we're keeping in mind in our future architecture and how we build. Cool. I don't think we have anyone up from the audience right now, but did we get Lenko to join again? Are you back? I'm back. I'm back. I had a bit of a technical issue. So one of the things that I wanted to share that I've seen from some of the first wave of apps that built extensions for customer accounts is that the editor experience hasn't necessarily been considered for merchants. And what I mean by that is that there aren't necessarily any previews of the extensions in the editor. And so there is a way when you are building an extension to use a type of check to see if your extension is being displayed inside of the editor, and you can kind of render a preview to the merchant. So they have a rough idea of what it'll look like to the buyer. If you don't have that preview, it's going to give the merchant the impression that the extension is actually broken and they're unlikely to actually add it to their customer experience. They'll really want to see what that looks like for their buyers. So as you're building out your extensions, definitely consider what the editor experience is like and what merchants will be previewing when they're configuring all the different extensions and how they work together. I think we actually have a dev doc on this. Kenza might be able to share that. That explains a little bit more on how to do that. Awesome. Yeah, I mean, that's a critical thing. I mean, from the merchant point of view, and we've been having conversations, there's a set of merchants that they've had installed apps that they already have, and they go into the editor to preview the functionality. And the extension works great to the customers, but it's hard for the merchant to understand it. The more that is intuitively explained, obviously the better. If you see opportunities for us to continue on that path and make it even better, definitely give us that path. Cool. Next question is from Cam Smith, who is not on the call, but I think is good for everyone to hear. We'll follow up probably with his tweet. But a question that a lot of people ask is, "Can you set a default page to redirect to after login?" And I think what Cameron wants to do is he wants to redirect to a custom full-page extension by default, so it's like when a customer is logging in for the first time, right now the default route takes you to the order list page. And it sounds like as you build other extensions, there's an idea to kind of default them. I can take this one, but I don't know, Graham, if you wanted to take it. Kenza, what do you guys think? I can give my take on this one for sure. I think it's not currently possible. So when someone logs in, you can redirect someone to a different page in the online store, but not to a full-page extension currently. So it's something we've talked about quite a bit. I think my take on it is it is something that eventually will make sense to happen. But a consideration, again, to make here is like giving the merchant optionality here. So don't make this an opinionated-- something that they would sort of see as a surprise in their extension. Make sure they still have the ability to direct to that regular order list page so that the customer can still get advantage of all of those other extensions rather than having to click back out of it again. So not currently possible today, but something we definitely want to enable. It's just about setting the right guidelines around it. But the use case is well understood for sure. Yeah, I would add to this in that one way to think about how to link to the correct destination is ultimately the way that our login works is that we have a-- I think when users first are clicking on something, there's a URL and a route that they're heading towards. So if they click-- right now, the default one in most themes is /account, which redirects to the order list page in customer accounts. And so when someone logs in, the reason they're going to order list is because that was their intended destination. And that's actually how all the URLs work within customer accounts. So if you were to create a kind of like hard link in the theme, or if you were to use a route in the theme that takes someone to the profile page, ultimately when they log in, they would end up on that profile page. So a workaround to this is that you can include your extension ID or your full page extension in that URL and have people link. But the key thing there is that you have to get into the theme and it starts with the entry point or where the customer is clicking from. And so there's a lot that I think can be played around there with. And we can continue to invest there. Lenko, Kenza, anything you want to add? Or should we hit another question? I was going to say the same thing, so go ahead. Cool. Next question. Let's see if he's in here. Looking around. No. Okay, next question is, "When will we get support for alternative login methods? Really, really need a phone number-based login." Is Pinto still on this call? I wonder if he was here. I wonder if we could just join him up. I can take this one because it's outside the extension roadmap. So with getting support for an alternate login methods, this is something that's on our roadmap in 2025. Some of the alternate login methods that we're--I think we've had a lot of good discussions in the customer accounts Slack-- or the Shopify partner customer accounts Slack channel that exists about exactly this and kind of, "Hey, what should we prioritize first?" And generally, our focus this year is on social login, so adding things like login with Google, et cetera. We're kind of at the beginning of kicking off this project, so you can imagine when you're R&Ding something at our scale, we are kicking this off and starting to prototype things. As we get better estimates, of course, we always like to share those and kind of give people a sense of where we're heading. But I think later this year, keep an eye out for supporting for social logins. Phone number-based login is something that a lot of people request and something that we are highly interested in. It's something that's kind of behind priority, behind social login. If you have thoughts on that, definitely bring that up. Feedback moves our roadmap, so the more feedback that we hear, the more that we'll move it in a direction and we'll deliver on it. Cool. Let me take a look at some of these next questions here. Should we ask if anyone here wants to raise their hand and ask a question live? Yeah, I love that. Should we just awkwardly sit here until somebody does? Like, do you want to come up? Also, Harshdeep, aren't you building customer account extensions right now for YAC? Do you want to talk about that? Everyone wants to listen. All right, I guess we could keep going. Yeah, I think while people are thinking about different questions, I think a couple of things I'd bring up before we dive back in is, I don't know if you guys saw, but we hardly posted the other day a pretty cool stat from the year that in 2024, 875 million customers bought something from a Shopify store. And kind of my take on this is that's a whole lot of customer accounts. And I think that that's an important thing for developers to know is that when you're building for Shopify new customer accounts, that's the level of impact potential here, is that your functionality can be kind of really easily added to a merchant's customer account space, and that the scale of the amount of impact that you can make for commerce is like crazy, crazy high, especially as the new customer account platform continues to be adopted. I think at the end of the year, we shared that over 50% of all Shopify merchants are now using new customer accounts. We've had lots of conversations with people that are like live migrating this last month. In fact, just actually this last week, I got on a call, and in about 15 minutes, we live migrated a $250 million merchant, and we turned on three different launch partner extensions, which is really exciting. Huge, huge opportunity as we get into that. I think we invited Tak Shah up. Any thoughts, questions you want to jam with us at all? I know we got into your question, but down to talk about other stuff too. Hey. Hi, guys. What's up, man? All cool. So yeah, the alternate login was not from an app dev's perspective. It was more of a merchant request, because I've had more than a few merchants request this. And I mean, this is pretty market subjective, I know, but merchants in India specifically really want mobile number-based logins. Got it. Would you prioritize that above different social logins, or curious how you would think about kind of the relative order if we had to choose one and kind of sequence this? Right. I mean, my opinion is going to be pretty subjective, because I see more demand for mobile number-based logins. It would be SMS-based or WhatsApp-based, something like that. But yeah, I see this being asked more. People are requesting this more from me. How often do you see, like, in your experience, like I know that there's that setting in Shopify checkout where you can allow people to check out with phone number only. Is that something that you see a lot more of as well there? So it's not phone number only, but phone number is mandatory for all customers for checkout, at least over here. Got it. And so I'm curious, like, I mean, that's something that we definitely think about is that people that check out with a phone number only wouldn't have the way to access customer accounts, because the only way to log in right now is through email. But yeah, no, that makes a ton of sense. Another thing I'd highlight here is we do have an integration with sign-in with Shop, which I know is not the same thing as being phone number login, but it's the same experience that you would at, the same way that you can kind of have buyers speed through checkout with Shopping, people can kind of speed through login, and that does have an SMS. It also has pass keys. That's another thing that we're looking at, of course, is like a login method. But, you know, do everything, but we're being kind of strategic with how we sequence right now. Yeah. So Shop is not available over here in India. That's US only, I think. And yeah, I did face into, like, I did run into the situation once that I enabled customer accounts for a merchant, and a few customers who had checked out using mobile number weren't able to access their order history anymore. So then I had to go ahead and revert back to old customer accounts so that the customers could at least get their order history. Got it. Got it. Makes sense. Any other questions while you're up here? No. All right. Cool. Thanks for coming up. Feel free to chime in as you see fit. Harshdeep, you're jumping up. What's up, man? Hey, how's everyone doing today? Doing great. Great. So I had a question, not with customer accounts directly, but like a lot of people, mostly me, missed out on the initial launch partner program. So is there like something else coming up as promo for building on customer accounts? I think we're always open to that. I mean, I think that we see this like launch partner program as kind of like a first step here. And one of the things that's actually happening out happening this week is we're sending out the first round of emails out to lots and lots of merchants about this. I think we'll see how that goes. But I don't see any reason why we wouldn't want to get more great apps in front of things, in front of our merchants. I think my take here, and I know that you're building an app, Harshdeep, so keep building. But as you build things, if you have something that's cool, reach out to us. Throw a DM to Lenko, Kenza, me. We're always looking to see that. And if we see something cool, we're going to always want to get it in front of our merchants. I don't know, Graham, Lenko, Kenza, any thoughts around creating other featuring moments? Yeah, I'll just plus one to what Patrick said. I mean, we're always open to new opportunities here. We are going to be hosting like as a sort of a follow on to some of the launch emails that we have. We're going to be hosting some webinars that focus on specific use cases over the next couple of months that we're going to get in front of merchants. So I would say let's let's chat about those opportunities and see if we can bring you in on that and maybe have you up as a speaker, Harshdeep. Oh, that's great. Thank you. Yeah. Another thing I'd add is that if you are planning marketing for your apps that have customer content, let us know if there's anything that we can do to help out. We're in. I know we've done some like shared webinars with apps that have said, hey, do you want to come up and talk with us about this? We're super into that. We like being there right there with you. So let us know. And of course, like we always like to have a lot of fun on social. So if there's anything we can do to create create waves with you, we're totally in. Any other thoughts, questions, Harshdeep? Oh, no, that's it. I'm like still in the process of building things and it's been going great so far. But this was one of the baseline questions I wanted to ask. Of course. How have you been how have you been thinking about like working across the entire extension platform? You know, like there's customer account extensions, checkout extensions, theme app extensions. How have you been thinking about that for YAC? So for people who don't know, YAC is a bulk gifting platform where you can give up to like a thousand people now all in one checkout. And then we take care of ensuring the order gets to the right people. So when it comes to like specifically customer account extensions, the idea here is we are also now allowing for auto editing just for your gifts and like swapping things out. So you could get notified. And from the customer account extension itself, you can kind of swap out, you know, maybe a different size of the product and everything else. So for me, it's like I'm setting up a banner. So just the way all your Ken's pointed out that. Each function kind of needs to have just one function. So each extension needs to have one function, which is the same as writing code, like a single entity does a single job. So it's like you have a banner that tells you like, hey, you're receiving a gift from this person. You have like three days if you want to modify your order or you want to swap something out. And that opens up a new full page extension that kind of allows you to swap things out. So that way it's like a multi extension set up in a way. But we've been trying it out with like two different plus merchants so far and they picked it up almost immediately. So, yeah, I think I'm in the right direction with this. And yeah, I think like that makes sense. I think actually this ties into another question that we just got recently. So I'm going to open this up to our speakers. Harshdeep, of course, if you ever have any thoughts, feel free to jump in the rest of the spaces. But someone asked, how should I think about the technical approach for adding new pages versus extending existing pages of order index and order status pages? Lenko, I think you probably have like a great take on this. Yeah, for sure. So I think one of the benefits of customer account extensibility is that it allows merchants to provide like a holistic and well integrated experience, even though they're using some third party apps to provide parts of those experiences. And so when you're building extensions, it's important that you keep that in mind and that you kind of be aware that your extension is going to be used alongside other extensions. And so if you build a full page extension, it removes the ability for other extensions to be placed around your app. Now, there's certainly use cases that make sense for a full page app extension. And so like it really is about the amount of real estate and functionality you need to provide to buyers. And so if there's a lot of content or a lot of functionality, for example, subscription management or, you know, looking at your environmental impact and the stories behind that, you might want to actually create a full page extension to share that content. But if it's more minimal functionality and it can kind of be well integrated into other aspects and areas of the platform, such as the orders list or the profile page or even the order status page, then, you know, building a smaller extension for those pages also makes sense. Now, one of the great things is you can actually do both and provide that flexibility to merchants. So if a merchant just wants to have, you know, like a small little extension on an order status page, they can do that. If they want to have a more robust page that has a lot of additional functionality, you can also offer them a full page extension. So it really is kind of about the different use cases that you're trying to solve for. And I'm just going to throw this out there to Harshdeep and anybody else listening. If you have kind of some UX questions and you're building extensions and want some UX feedback, my DMs are open. I would love to see extensions. I love sharing feedback. I look at a ton of different extensions. And so I'm more than happy to provide UX feedback as you're going through your build process. But that's how I would think about, you know, whether or not you should build a full page extension or an individual kind of inline extension. Yeah, and I would I would I would bump up. Nick Lenko is a serious person. That really means what he says, that he'll do UX reviews with any of you. I know we did an enormous amount of really detailed UX reviews throughout the Launch Partner Program. But we want to keep that going. And that really helps us getting into the weeds and jamming with you on your specific thing. Helps us understand, like, do we have the right extension targets? Do we have the right components? This feedback is what literally drives our roadmap. So the more that you share, the better. So really appreciate everybody that, like, will send us like a video or a screenshot of things that they're working on. We do circulate that stuff internally. And so, yeah, please, please do that. Please bother Nick Lenko as much as possible publicly with with UX questions on this. I'd also add to the point of what Nick said is that oftentimes people build extensions across these order index, order status or full page extensions that they rely on each other and link to each other. And for that, I always recommend using extension collections. Extension collections are this really awesome thing where you can kind of merchandise these extensions that, like, work together to the merchant within the editor and make it really easy for them to add all of them at once. So that the merchant knows that they all these functionality build across these pages work together. We have another speaker who's someone I love chatting with. Ayush, what's up, man? Welcome. Welcome to the AMA. Hey, Patrick, it's been a while since we last spoke. Yeah, welcome. Go for it. I don't know if we lost Ayush or not. Do we still have him there? I guess Lenko, do you hear Ayush or did we drop him? I think there was a technical problem. I don't see him as a speaker anymore. Okay, cool. All right. Well, I think while we're getting that sorted out, I think we have other questions from the crowd. We've got, is there a roadmap to add a list of meta objects from Remco here? I think, Graham, you most recently worked on a feature similar to this. I don't know if you'd want to kind of chime in there. Yeah. So no specific timeline on meta objects specifically. What we do have is Customer Account API actually now supports writing to meta fields. So what that means is you can actually expose a field to a customer that allows them to actually update a preference that would live on their customer record that a merchant can then use to customize the rest of the experience. So meta object support. Let's chat a little bit more about that. Toss me a note. My DMs are also open. I would love to better understand the use case there and how we're falling short now. But yeah, meta fields currently supported, but there's certainly more work to be done there. Yeah, and that's actually a good point that I drop at is when we get these feedback requests for specific things like this, this is always super helpful. But of course, we always want to thoughtfully understand the use case behind it. So I'd strongly encourage as you throw your feedback, which always throw your feedback at us. Excuse me. Always throw your feedback at us. It's always helpful to hear the use case behind it. That's something that all of our team will always ask for because it helps us get a sense of priority or urgency, etc. But always a good thing to ask. I think, Ayush, you're back. I think I saw your hand raised. Did we sort out the technical difficulties? Yeah, I think I was having some network issues. Can you confirm if you can hear me now? I can hear you. What's up? Welcome. Thanks for having me. It's been a while. So I would like to start with a continuation in the question what Daksh asked about logins. So a lot of merchants have a pop up on their home screen through which they get the signups. So I'm wondering how the new login is compatible with that. Yeah. So right now, login all happens on another domain. There's a lot of, I think, security and strategic reasons for that. And I can get into those. The tool that we launched, I don't know, I think Bailey Barrow was on this call for a little bit. I don't see him on there anymore. But he asked about this feature a lot, is that the ability to have people start a login from the online store and redirect back. Right now, the best way that I would recommend people to support kind of like a pop up or any login in context on the online store is to use that feature. It's a new liquid route that allows you to return someone to any page in the online store. Oftentimes what we've seen with the login pop up on the online store or on the storefront that people are trying to do is ultimately log them in in context and stay on the online store. And so that's a way that you can return the user back very quickly. This is an area that we continue to think about as how can we make sure that people can log in the simplest, easiest way. I know some stuff Graham and I have been kind of kicking around and this is something that's more in the pre pre staffed, pre funded on a roadmap phase. But thinking about ways that like, how could someone maybe type in an email and start a login from the online store and go directly to the one time password page as a way to kind of bridge that gap and and make it happen faster. But generally speaking, I would say start with the login redirects that we just launched. You could still have something in a pop up that says log in, but that when you upon click it would take someone to our passwordless login. Does that make sense? Yeah, that definitely makes sense. But it would be really nice to have something like an API to directly log in without any redirects. Yeah, tell me about like the customer experience you'd love to create. Like it'd be great to kind of dive a little bit deeper there. Yeah, so we are actually working on a new app around customer experience to enhance it another level. So we would love to have a node redirect flow where the customer could just get into a store and give their email ID and login details so that we can create an ecosystem around that for that store and create a personalized experience. So a login without redirect, I think would be a big enough motivator for someone to actually sign up for the store. That's awesome. I mean, yeah, we I mean, we are really bullish on the idea is that like we think that this new way of getting lots of self serve functionality in one space is going to drive lots of logins. Ultimately, we want to make that as easy as possible. But I think personalized storefronts is like going to be the opportunity for merchants and devs, I think going into this year and future years as well. Any thoughts like Lenko, Kenza, Graham on like login, UX related, product related? Kind of open it up. I think just the one thing I would add to that is that, you know, we see that buyers log in for to complete a task. If they see a login button, they're just not going to click it unless they have a reason to click it. And so if you use what Patrick was mentioning, the login redirect, and you advertise kind of like a benefit or a task that the user might want to complete and then kind of link to our login page and then redirect them back to the online store. I think that they would still feel comfortable about using the authentication system that we provide out of the box. And it's not a huge deal that it necessarily kind of goes to a different page and then ultimately brings them back to where they started. Definitely. Yeah, just like double. Oh, go for it, Kenza. Yeah, I was going to say just to add on top of what Nick was saying. Yes, people do log in to perform a task and a common task that people need to do is take action on their order. So edit an order, cancel an order, request a return. And this is why we've baked in login into order actions. So if you use an order action extension, by default, if a customer is not logged in and they click on one of these actions, they will be asked to log in for security reasons. But again, because they're in the process of taking an action, they're way more likely to log in rather than if you just put the login button in front of them and expect them to click it to actually go in and proceed with the login. Yeah, to share a principle we have internally is like buyers don't want to log in, they want to get something done. And we continually see those actions as the number one CTA that drive the best login conversion. We also, I think, as a result, encourage that. I think that one of the benefits to Ken's saying of linking someone directly to an order page is that as you're developing this personalized experience, and you want to guide the buyer to where they can take action on their order. As a developer that's building the website, you might not know of all the different order actions and functionality that a merchant has set up there. So by linking to that order page, you're linking to the page that the merchant wants them to their customers to go to the one page for orders, and that allows them to do everything that they want to want to do. Cool. I also dropped the login redirect feature is very, very new. We launched it the last day before like deploy locks before people left for the Christmas holiday. I just dropped it in the different threads there if you want to read about it. There's like a guide on how to use it and a guide on a video of how it's being implemented into a theme that you can take a peek at. Cool. I'm seeing other questions here, but I want to make sure that we've got other speakers if anyone wants to come up and kind of jam with us. I'm sorry, I just had one more question. Oh, yeah, hit it. Yeah, so I think it would be quite helpful for everyone building in the Salesforce space. So right now, I see you have a lot of hooks around getting data for an order on the order status page or just hooks to get like extension data. So I was wondering like if there are going to be more customizations coming in, for example, in the get order data hook that is there on the customer account UI extension and react. Can we get more data on it? For example, like order tags or just more order details or like more data in all the hooks or customizable data? Is there like specific data that you're like saying, hey, this doesn't exist that you're like, oh, man, if I had this, this would be good. Also, if that's something you want to DM me separately, I'm totally down for it. Sure, I'll bring it to you. Yeah, order tag is like the one of the most important. I feel that should be there. Got it. So generally, our approach with customer account extensions is that you should be using the customer account API as much as possible. Initially, we matched what was available to checkout extensions, because this page historically was a checkout page, and then it was moved to customer accounts. So we didn't want to introduce any breaking changes with it moving to customer accounts. So we kept the same API. But outside of the order page, there isn't really that much data that we expose to extensions. And the reason why is because we want extensions to query the data that they need from the customer account API. We can't know what every extension is going to need, and we can't query all the data that is available, because that is going to affect the performance a lot. So if there's data that you need, it should be available from the customer account API. If it isn't, please, please let us know. Yeah, and I would add to what Ken's saying by mentioning that we do have the ability for you to allow customers to write to order in customer metafields from the customer account API, which allows you to, I think, extend the data that's available to be queried there on your own. You can also, I think merchants can set that themselves, which you can use as a developer, something to consider. Cool. Feel free, I think we've got like 10, 15 more minutes. So if you want to chat with us, come on up. We're down to chit chat. Looking here, we've got from, I think, Chirag here. When can we use this for headless stores? What I can see is we cannot use the new customer accounts for hydrogen stores and thus no extensions. I have a take on this, but I don't know, Graham, Kenza, Nick, if you want to chat about this, or I can kind of set the stage either way. Yeah, I mean, I think you can. There's some weirdness around using customer accounts with headless, like the customer accounts portal in particular, specifically like the, I think some links, for example, like the buy again button will try to recreate the order in the online store. So it doesn't work well with headless. I think we have less and less online store specific features, though, like the go to store button was removed and now it is part of the menu, which can be edited. But yeah, I mean, I think it should work. There's probably other things I'm not thinking of, but I think there's a little bit of weirdness, but it should work. Patrick, what are your thoughts? Yeah, that's correct. I think that we can do a better job of like telling the story. I'm going to drop a link in the main threads, Shopify developers, like Spaces thread about this. There's a hydrogen and a headless redirect theme that exists that we recommend using. So what that does is essentially when you, with new customer accounts, all the links from it all default to linking to the online store. And so if you use like this redirect theme that I just linked here, that allows you to basically have your links from new customer accounts or linking to the online store automatically redirect to the correct page structure of your hydrogen or headless store. And that path really allows you to separate and say, hey, I want to stay headless or I want to stay with hydrogen on the front end of my storefront. But I really want to take advantage of the scale and extensions of new, with new customer accounts, with customer account extensions. And that gives you the ability to, I think, have that kind of dual experience. And that hybrid experience that we've seen is very attractive, I think, to merchants that have hydrogen and headless stores and are really excited by the customization there. But then aren't really excited about the idea of like maintaining this large, you know, feature development of customer accounts. And they really like the benefit of scaling with our partners in a lot of those areas. So that's something that I think that we do see as a pattern there. And I would highly recommend using the hydrogen redirect thing. And then there is a headless redirect theme that the community made as well. And I'll drop that on that tweet also. So I think that's a really, really good point and something that we can probably tell a better story about. But it is possible and something that I have been seeing a lot of headless and hydrogen merchants take advantage of. Of course, the other side of this is that some people are even building just with the customer account API. We do make that available to headless and hydrogen stores, and they have access to all the features. And they can build that. And we've seen some people really lean into that path. We see that more above merchants, I would say, around like the $100 million, $150 million range and above of yearly revenue. It's really about people that can work with an agency for an extended period of time or hire their own devs, etc. They've seen like most successful with that approach. I think Max requested to come up. Do you want to get him up here? What up, Max? Hey, how's it going? Pretty good. Good morning so far. Fun conversations. Yeah, thanks for having this. I got a quick question. Is this a good time? Let's do it. Perfect. I'm trying to figure out what the best practice is here for rendering conditional account extension pages. So say, for example, I had a VIP program, maybe customers are tagged with like VIP. And then in account extensions, I want like a VIP portal for them. Obviously, we're not going to show that to all customers. From what I can tell, there's no way to dynamically render nav links. So would your best practice be like a block extension that then links to that full page extension? I think you cut out for me. If, Kendra, you have an answer, go for it. Yeah, so I mean, at this time, yes. There are features coming in the next year that are going to make this easier for merchants to control. So for merchants, merchants, for example, will be able to target a specific segment of customers. Let's say they create a segment for all customers with a VIP tag. And via the checkout and accounts editor, they could have a different nav menus, like different menus, depending on that customer. So features are coming in the next year that are merchant facing for this. I'll let Lenko speak to whether he thinks a block is the best short term alternative for this. Yeah, I think that that would probably be the best short term option right now. The block can just be a simple entry point or maybe just like a minimized version of the content on the full page extension. I would also just be curious if there is a need for a full page extension for this and if it could actually all just live within a larger inline extension to kind of prevent that need, at least in the short term. But as Kenza mentioned, we are looking to solve for this this year. Okay, awesome. Thank you so much. Yeah, Max, I would say too, if you get into some specific UX or some mockups, we'd love to review them with you and we can even give a more detailed answer to that. If you want to record a video or something and just pop it into Lenko, me, or Lenko's DMs, then we can get into it or we could hop on a call. We're super into that. Okay, awesome. That's great. Thank you guys so much. Yeah, I think just to speak to a bit of the green path, I think Kenza alluded to, I think we see a world, I think as we've been talking about this narrative of that, the more people that, the more you have self serve functionality behind login, the more people be logged in, the more that there's opportunity to personalize the experience. And there's many different ways to personalize the experience. I think one of the things you're talking about is like a VIP customer list or something, they log in, you know who they are, and they get a slightly different experience. I know that effort internally is something that many teams are working together to make happen. And I think to tease it out a way that we're thinking about it in the long, long view, that I don't have a timeline on, is the idea that you can create different customer segments and groups of people. And then based off of the people in those customer segments, you can target customizations on the online store within customer accounts or within checkout and let the merchants even build some of those things themselves. So like a merchant could set up a customer segment and then basically say, "Hey, when a customer that hits this segment's logged in, how can I have this extension enabled in customer accounts and maybe this extension not enabled?" And that's like a pretty big idea. And you can imagine it's a pretty large development to allow you to like sliver off every single part of all of our surface areas infinitely. It's a pretty large thing to do, but I think that's where we're generally headed down the path. In the meantime, we see such a large, large opportunity there. I think we have time for maybe one more question, if we have a speaker come up real quick. Otherwise, I think we're going to have to wrap here soon so that we can all get back to building all these and acting on all this such great feedback. Any last person that wants to come up? All righty. I'm going to try to close this off here. Some things that I always want to say whenever I have a little bit of an audience that cares about customer accounts is something to keep an eye on is that our intention with customer accounts is to, I think, build this new platform in a way that greatly creates way more merchant value and way more dev, the value that devs can create for merchants and way more value for their customers. With that, our plan is to eventually deprecate legacy customer accounts. That's why you see us do the name from classic to legacy. We really want to make sure that everybody knows that our intention is to get rid of this thing, to sunset it and deprecate it. Along with that are things like multi-pass, the liquid pages that legacy customer accounts come with. Some of the customer portions of the storefront API are all things that we see us moving away from. We don't have a deprecation timeline yet. A lot of our focus right now is building some of these different gaps or opportunities or just gaining confidence in our approach. But I think we're rapidly heading towards a path where I don't want anyone to be shocked when we announce a deprecation timeline for legacy customer accounts. When we do that, we'll probably give around a year of time for people to adjust to this. I think that as you have feedback for us or as you're trying to grok this, if you yourself come across like, "Hey, I know my merchant needs this platform functionality and new customer accounts," definitely bubble that up. The earlier that you share that to us, the easier it will be for everyone that goes through this transition together. Really, we want to do this in the smartest, best way possible. We take in so much feedback and are really, really diligent about it. But of course, you guys are all building for your own sets of merchants and your own sets of conversations that everything are happening. So definitely bubble that up. That feedback and stories is what I think allows us to plan effectively and make sure that there's not some moment that everyone's super surprised or anything like this. It is coming. It's something we're working really hard towards. We're taking lots of feedback in this area, and I think we have a good take on some of the things that we need to build, like a native registration form or social logins or all sorts of different things that were discussed on this call. And yeah, we're really excited to continue building with everyone here. We've got so much marketing planned to merchants to drive them to customer account extensions. I expect everyone building customer account extensions to win huge in 2025 just because of how much Shopify is going to be pushing people into this approach. And not only that, but just how much merchants are organically driving into new customer accounts themselves. I was talking to Brian from Wondermint. Shout out, Brian, from Wondermint. And he was telling me like in his 10 demos a week that he's been doing with customers, maybe two or three of them are reaching out and asking proactively about new customer accounts. I think like Arvin from Wishlist Plus has been sharing kind of similar things of like, man, I'm hearing all these people organically come into it. So I really think if you're a Shopify developer and you don't know about customer account extensions, you're behind. And we want to help you catch up. We want to help you get into that. But this is, I think, the big opportunity. I think there's gonna be some big winners in this space as people go into it. And we're here to support you along the way. So I think that we're gonna wrap the spaces. I don't know, Lenko, Kenza, Graham, our Shopify devs, homies. Anything else you want to conclude here? Just want to reiterate that my DMs are open. If you have UX mockups of your extensions or prototypes that you want us to take a look at, I would be more than happy to do that. Yeah, nothing to add, but just a continuous call for feedback here. Please keep telling us what you're looking for, what merchant experiences you're trying to build, how you're making merchant lives better. And we'll prioritize those things. You really drive our roadmap. So appreciate all the feedback here. Yeah, and I want to give a shout out to all the developers out there who give feedback, who tell us when something's wrong. We've got so many issues because of you all telling us about them. And yeah, really appreciate everyone being vocal about this stuff. Yes, be vocal and don't hold back. Let it out how you're feeling about it. We can take it. Also, I'd shout out the Shopify Dev Community Forums. It's a great place to bring feedback. Also, the Shopify Partner Slack has a customer accounts channel. All of us are in it. We have lots of conversations. We'll even get into prioritization discussions with people on these things. So just definitely chime things our way. If you hit a speaker thing and had a question that wasn't answered, feel free to ask it on the thread. I think we'll try to take some time to answer all those questions. So yeah, shoot that our way. And much love. And everyone, have a great week and looking forward to talking to you again real soon. Bye.
